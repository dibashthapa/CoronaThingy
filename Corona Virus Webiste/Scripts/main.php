    Coronaviridae family.It is a tramsittable diesases.It mostly affects old people, people relying on medical treatment and people with low immunity.
    This virus is commanly found in live stock and humans.The novel Corona Virus is a completely new virus.This can be easily transmitted form human to human.</p>";


    echo"<h2>How the the spread of the virus begin?</h2>";

     echo"<p>The virus was first found in Wuhan Province of China around the time of the chinise new year.Due to the festival many people travelled and so did the virus.
     The authorities started getting suspicious when many people reported pneumonia like symtomps.Soon the first death was reported.It was a old chinese man . The virus had
     been traced back to the seafood market of Wuhan.

    Then the virus spread across Japan,South Korea,the US,Canada,Malaysia.Then it came to Italy.It spread
    to Europe then it Italy's open borders.The most hit countires with the corona virus as per  2020-3-25 are:

    <ul>
    <li>  USA 142,735 cases</li>
    <li> Italy 97,689 cases</li>
    <li> China 81,470 cases</li>
    <li>  Spain 80,110 cases</li>

    </ul>
    </p>";


    echo"<h2>How Does the Virus Spread</h2>";

    echo"<p>The virus spreads through physical contact.Lets take an example;a person sneezes adn covers with theri mouth.Now the virus could
    be in the mouth.Then s/he handshakes with another person.Now the virus is in the other person.Similarly the other person has physical contact with the other person.
In this way the virus spreads.Other ways the virus spreads include : Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.I
t may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose,
or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.The scientists found that the virus was detectable in air for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper,
up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.
 </p>";

 echo"<h2>How does the virus harms the body</h2>";
 echo"<p>

 When the virus first spreads,It usually goes to the lungs,intestines,etc.First the virus goes to our cells in our lungs called the epithelial tissues.Then it constantly
 reproduces itself until the cell is dead.This creates alot of the same virus and it spreads within the body. Thsi creates tens of millions of those cells.

 But thats not the dangerous part.The virus then create confusion in our immune system.They make the immune system attcak on the body and harm healthy cells.This wastes alot of
 engery of the person.This may cause harmful damages including lifelong disabilities.

 To protect the body the immune system works to fight the virus.Hence stronger immune system is required to combat the virus and people who are killed due to this virus usually
 are old or have weak immune system.
